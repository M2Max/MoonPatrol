# Moon Patrol

Moon Patrol is a game, in this case a python program that allows you to play the famous asian arcade vintage game directly on your pc. 
One of my best friends and I developed it togheter as a university project, saving it as memory of all the work we put in on this project in our freshman year (We got full marks!).
